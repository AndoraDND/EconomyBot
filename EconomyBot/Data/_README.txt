EconomyBot Data Directory

All of the files within this folder are intended to be copied to the Data folder in the build output. 
This will not be there by default, as the folder is created automatically after the program's first run. 

As of now, since we will be eventually moving to a Linux-based runtime, I have not added any automatic copying after build. 
For now, just manually copy this folder (".\Data") to the same location as the bot's executable file and the rest should work as intended.
Optionally, you can run the program once and ignore the errors, just copying the necessary files into location. 
Your choice.

As for the TokenCredentials file, it will be blank by default. As this is sensitive data, it will not be shared on github. 
Just ask Bribzy#6715 for the Token if you intend to be using this for testing purposes.

Happy developing!
